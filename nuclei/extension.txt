  When developing a piece of code, finding syntaxic and sematic errors
  (especially in long pieces of code) is much easier when when the compiler
  highlights where in the code has triggered an error.

  Therefore, in this parser and interpreter program, when running a file using
  "make extension" and "./extension example_file.ncl" if there is an error with
  the example_file code, a detailed error message displays in the terminal,
  indicating the point of failure.

  An example of the detailed error message:
  [Filename]:[Line]:[Offset]: NUCLEI error: expected two LIST inputs in SET
    (SET A "Example Error")
                         ^
  The error message includes:
   - Filename
   - Line number
   - Character offset
   - Description of error
   - The line of code in error
   - A caret (^) pointer to the point of error detection.

  The error message is coloured and formatted in the style of a terminal
  complier error messages.

For example: use with literal_parsepass_interpfail.ncl from blackboard.
