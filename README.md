# C_Projects

This repo contains the following functional programming in C assignments I completed during university:

1) **BinGrid** - Solves binary grid puzzles from grids input as strings. Puzzle examples can be found at [binarypuzzle.com](https://www.binarypuzzle.com/).

2) **CarParks** - Uses a brute force searching algorithm to return the number of moves required to manoeuvre "cars" from "carpark". Carpark inputs are specified from external .prk files.

3) **Lisp** - Creates, manipulates and performs various operations on [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language) data strucutres using linked list and string representations.

4) **Nuclei** - Tokenises, parses and interprets Lisp language inputs based on a custom formal grammar.
